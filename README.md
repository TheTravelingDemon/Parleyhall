Parleyhall
A forum based website going back to the roots of the old internet based around discussion of topics you love and less about wasting your time.

It will have different communities called "Halls". Each Hall being a differenet topic about anything the user wants. A niche game, writing, internet mysteries, memes, you can make a Hall for anything!

CORE FEATURES:

upvotes only, as downvotes are abused and make discussion less appealing. Most people on for exaple Reddit just use the downvote system as a way to disagree with the comment. By removing the dislike button, instead of disliking and contine scrolling, if you want to disagree with the person that made the comment, you have to reply to that person. Creating more disccussion and less about reactions.
Webs: Each reply is a new web. Each web you can slide up after reading if you'd like.
profiles: No paid annoying figures, no NFT bullshit, just choose your profile icon from a list of ours or your very own image.
UI: A better fucking UI than a certain shitificationed one.
Less Moderation than other websites: Hypermodereated is sadly common on a lot of websites today on the internet these days. Parleyhall has rules, but you can discuss anything you want except for illegal content, of course. You want to discuss politics? Feel free to discuss right-leaning and left-leaning poltics on the appropriate Halls without being banned by left-leaning/-right-leaning mods/admins that don't know what opinons are.
No locked posts. If a post is years old, you can still reply to it. Or if a post has heated arguments, the post cannot be locked. This is a place for discussion, if a post has arguments then discuss it to your hearts content.
