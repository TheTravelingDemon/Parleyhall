## Overview 
Parleyhall is a forum based website going back to the roots of the old internet based around discussion of topics you love with light moderation and less shitified UI.

It will have different communities called "Halls". Each Hall being a different topic about anything the user wants. A niche game, writing, internet mysteries, memes, you can make a Hall for anything you want.

### CORE FEATURES:

* Like/Dislike System: As downvotes are abused and make discussion less appealing. Most people on for example Reddit just use the downvote system as a way to disagree with the comment. By removing the dislike button instead of disliking and continue scrolling, if the user wants to disagree with the person that made the comment, you have to reply to that person. Creating more discussion and less about reactions.
* Webs: Each reply is a new "Web." Each Web (reply) you can slide up after reading if you'd like to have more space without scrolling down.
* profiles: No paid annoying figures, no NFTs, just choose your profile icon from a list of ours or your very own image.
* No locked posts. If a post is years old, you can still reply to it. Or if a post has heated arguments, the post cannot be locked by mods or admins. This is a place for discussion, if a post has arguments then discuss it to your hearts content.
* UI: A less shitified one. More posts on your screen and less overly modern/minimilistic like so many websites today. And loads of costimization! 
* No HyperModeration: Hypermodereated is sadly common on a lot of websites on the internet these days. Parleyhall has rules, but you can discuss anything you want except for illegal content, of course. Think X, but in Reddits body. You want to discuss politics? Feel free to discuss right-leaning and left-leaning politics on the appropriate Halls without being banned by left-leaning/-right-leaning mods/admins that don't know what opinions are. The platform is for open, civil discourse where all perspectives are welcome on everything. Fostering understanding across ideological divides.



### Community Guidelines
While we encourage open conversation, our platform is not a free-for-all such as 4chan. Discussions must:
- Be respectful. Not much to ask really. No herassment, no doxxing. No extremism. No incitement. 
- Stay constructive, as this is a place for discussion even when debating sensitive issues.

### My experience programming
- This project here. I've only learned HTML, CSS, Javascript (and soon to be more!) with no other built projects as of yet. This is a long-term passion project I want to work on as I learn more about programming.
