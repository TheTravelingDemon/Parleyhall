## Overview 
Parleyhall is a forum based website going back to the roots of the old internet based around discussion of topics you love with light moderation and less shitified UI.

It will have different communities called "Halls". Each Hall being a different topic about anything the user wants. A niche game, writing, internet mysteries, memes, you can make a Hall for anything you want.

### Core Features:

* Like/Dislike System: As downvotes are abused and make discussion less appealing. Most people on for example Reddit just use the downvote system as a way to disagree with the comment. By removing the dislike button instead of disliking and continue scrolling, if the user wants to disagree with the person that made the comment, you have to reply to that person. Creating more discussion and less about reactions.
* Webs: Each reply is a new "Web." Each Web (reply) you can collapse or expand after reading if you'd like to have more space without scrolling down. 
* profiles: No paid annoying PFPs, no NFTs, just choose your profile icon from a list of ours or your very own image.
* No locked posts. If a post is years old, you can still reply to it. Or if a post has heated arguments, the post cannot be locked by mods or admins. This is a place for discussion, if a post has arguments then discuss it to your hearts content.
* UI: A less over-commercialized and simplefied one. More posts on your screen and less overly modern/minimilistic like so many websites today. And loads of customization! change colors, fonts, or different layouts of the website. For ones that like the modern and simplefied UI, we have a version for you! If you like the look of bare-bones UI of the early 2000s, theres one for you as well!
* Light Moderation: Hyper-moderated spaces is sadly common on a lot of websites on the internet these days. Parleyhall has rules, but you can discuss any topic, from politics to conspiracies, without fear of heavy-handed and unwarranted bans. We welcome all viewpoints, provided they follow our guidelines for respect and constructiveness. Think X, but in Reddit's body. You want to discuss politics? Feel free to discuss right-leaning and left-leaning politics on the appropriate Halls without being banned by left-leaning/-right-leaning mods/admins. The platform is for open, civil discourse where all perspectives are welcome on everything. Fostering understanding across ideological divides.



### Community Guidelines
While we encourage open conversation, our platform is not a free-for-all such as 4chan. Discussions must:
- Be respectful. We expect basic courtesy. No harassment, no doxxing. No extremism. No incitement. 
- Stay constructive, as this is a place for discussion even when debating sensitive issues.

### My experience programming
- I’m a (very) beginner programmer with experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Parleyhall is my long-term passion project as I learn more about programming.

- ## Why Parleyhall?
Unlike platforms with overly-restrictive moderated or overly simplifed interfaces, Parleyhall prioritizes open, respectful dialogue across all topics. We don’t endorse any viewpoints—whether political, speculative, or personal—but provide a space where they can be discussed fairly without being worried of being patronized. Parleyhall's UI will pay homage to less modern UIs of times past and give users something nice to look at as discuss where opinons thrive.
