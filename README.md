## Overview 
Parleyhall is a forum based website going back to the roots of the old internet based around discussion of topics you love with light moderation and less shitified UI.

It will have different communities called "Halls". Each Hall being a different topic about anything the user wants. A niche game, writing, internet mysteries, memes, you can make a Hall for anything you want.

CORE FEATURES:

* upvotes system: As downvotes are abused and make discussion less appealing. Most people on for exaple Reddit just use the downvote system as a way to disagree with the comment. By removing the dislike button, instead of disliking and contine scrolling, if you want to disagree with the person that made the comment, you have to reply to that person. Creating more disccussion and less about reactions.
* Webs: Each reply is a new web. Each web you can slide up after reading if you'd like.
* profiles: No paid annoying figures, no NFT bullshit, just choose your profile icon from a list of ours or your very own image.
* UI: A better fucking UI than a certain shitificationed one.
* No HyperModeration: Hypermodereated is sadly common on a lot of websites on the internet these days. Parleyhall has rules, but you can discuss anything you want except for illegal content, of course. You want to discuss politics? Feel free to discuss right-leaning and left-leaning poltics on the appropriate Halls without being banned by left-leaning/-right-leaning mods/admins that don't know what opinions are. The platform is for open, civil discourse where all perspectives are welcome on everything. Fostering understanding across ideological divides.
* No locked posts. If a post is years old, you can still reply to it. Or if a post has heated arguments, the post cannot be locked. This is a place for discussion, if a post has arguments then discuss it to your hearts content.


### Community Guidelines
While we encourage open conversation, our platform is not a free-for-all such as 4chan. Discussions must:
- Be at least kinda respectful not much to ask 
- Stay constructive, as this is a place for discussion even when debating sensitive issues.

### My experience programming
- pretty much noffin. I've only learned HTML, CSS, Javascript with no other built projects. This is a long-term passion project I want to work on as I learn more about programming.
